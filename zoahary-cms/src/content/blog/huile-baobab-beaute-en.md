## Introduction

Baobab oil, extracted from the seeds of this majestic African tree, is an ancestral Malagasy beauty secret. Rich in vitamins A, D, E and F, as well as essential fatty acids, it offers exceptional benefits for skin and hair. At Zoahary, we produce 100% pure and organic baobab oil, cold-pressed to preserve all its nutrients.

## 1. Intense Skin Hydration

Baobab oil penetrates quickly without leaving a greasy film. Its richness in omega-3, 6 and 9 fatty acids restores the skin barrier and maintains natural skin hydration, even for very dry skin.

## 2. Natural Anti-Aging

Thanks to its high content of vitamins A and E, baobab oil stimulates collagen production, reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and improves skin elasticity. It's a powerful antioxidant that fights free radicals responsible for skin aging.

## 3. Soothing for Sensitive Skin

The anti-inflammatory properties of baobab oil make it a precious ally for irritated skin, prone to eczema or psoriasis. It soothes redness and itching while strengthening the skin's protective barrier.

## 4. Restorative Hair Care

Apply baobab oil to lengths and ends to deeply nourish dry and damaged hair. It repairs split ends, provides shine and suppleness, and protects against external aggressions (sun, pollution, heat).

## 5. Treatment for Stretch Marks and Scars

Baobab oil promotes cell regeneration and improves the appearance of stretch marks and scars. Massage the affected areas daily to stimulate collagen production and even out skin tone.

## 6. Nail Strengthener

Massage your nails and cuticles with a few drops of baobab oil to strengthen them, prevent breakage and promote their growth. Vitamins and minerals deeply nourish the nail matrix.

## 7. Gentle and Effective Makeup Remover

Baobab oil is an excellent natural makeup remover, even for waterproof makeup. It cleanses gently while nourishing the skin, without stripping or aggressing.

## How to Use Baobab Oil

**For the face**: Apply 2-3 drops on clean skin, morning and/or evening, massaging gently.

**For hair**: As a pre-shampoo mask (30 min to 1h) or on ends as a leave-in treatment.

**For the body**: Apply generously after showering on still damp skin to optimize absorption.

## Conclusion

Baobab oil is a true natural beauty elixir, suitable for all skin and hair types. At Zoahary, we are committed to offering you superior quality, ethical and traceable oil to reveal your natural beauty. Discover our pure baobab oil in our Products section.
