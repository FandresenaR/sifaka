## Introduction

The baobab, called "Renala" (Mother of the forest) or "Reniala" in Malagasy, is much more than just a tree in Madagascar. It's a sacred symbol, a cultural pillar and a source of life for local communities. With six endemic species out of the eight existing in the world, Madagascar is the true kingdom of the baobab. Discover the fascinating history of this thousand-year-old tree.

## The Legend of the Upside-Down Tree

According to Malagasy legend, the gods, angered by the baobab's vanity as it boasted of being the most beautiful tree of creation, uprooted it and replanted it upside down. That's why its branches look like roots pointing to the sky. This legend illustrates the cultural and spiritual importance of the baobab in the Malagasy imagination.

## The Six Endemic Species of Madagascar

Madagascar is home to unique baobab biodiversity:

**Adansonia grandidieri**: The most famous, that of the Avenue of the Baobabs in Morondava, which can reach 30 meters high.

**Adansonia za**: The most widespread, present in the dry forests of the west and south.

**Adansonia madagascariensis**: Recognizable by its massive and cylindrical trunk.

**Adansonia rubrostipa**: The smallest, with magnificent yellow flowers.

**Adansonia perrieri**: The most threatened species, limited to the north of the island.

**Adansonia suarezensis**: Endemic to the Diego Suarez region (Antsiranana).

## Cultural and Spiritual Importance

For the Malagasy, the baobab is a sacred tree with a soul. It serves as a community gathering place, ancestral cemetery and ceremonial site. Some centuries-old baobabs are considered spiritual guardians of villages.

Malagasy griots and storytellers traditionally gather under baobabs to transmit oral history, legends and traditions to new generations.

## A Pillar of Daily Life

The baobab offers a multitude of resources to local communities:

**Food**: The fruit pulp, rich in vitamin C, is consumed fresh or transformed into a refreshing drink. Young leaves are eaten as vegetables.

**Traditional Medicine**: Bark, leaves and roots are used to treat numerous ailments: fever, diarrhea, infections, respiratory problems.

**Crafts**: Bark fibers are used to make ropes, mats, baskets and traditional fabrics.

**Water**: The hollow trunk can store up to 120,000 liters of water during the dry season.

## The Baobab in the Local Economy

Today, the baobab has become an important source of income for rural Malagasy communities. Sustainable harvesting of pulp, seeds for oil, and leaves generates jobs and supports local development.

At Zoahary, we work directly with local cooperatives in respect of traditions and the environment, guaranteeing fair remuneration and fair trade.

## Conservation and Environmental Issues

Despite their majesty, Madagascar's baobabs are threatened by deforestation, climate change and extensive agriculture. Several species are classified as critically endangered.

Conservation initiatives, supported by international and local organizations, aim to protect these thousand-year-old giants and promote their planting.

## The Avenue of the Baobabs: A National Treasure

The Avenue of the Baobabs, near Morondava, is one of Madagascar's most iconic sites. These 800-year-old Adansonia grandidieri baobabs attract thousands of visitors each year and are candidates for UNESCO World Heritage status.
