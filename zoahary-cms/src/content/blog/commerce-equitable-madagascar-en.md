## Introduction

At Zoahary, fair trade is not just a label, it's a philosophy embedded in everything we do. Since our establishment in Tulear (Toliara), in southwestern Madagascar, we work hand in hand with local communities to create an ethical, sustainable and transparent value chain. Discover our social impact and commitment to a better future.

## Our Presence in Tulear

Tulear, the baobab capital of Madagascar, is the heart of our operations. This region, rich in biodiversity but facing economic challenges, is home to the world's most beautiful baobab forests. This is where we chose to establish our base to maximize our positive impact.

## Direct Partnership with Local Cooperatives

### A Fair Trade Model

We work directly with 12 harvester cooperatives around Tulear, representing over 300 Malagasy families. This direct partnership eliminates intermediaries and guarantees:

- **Fair remuneration**: Prices 40% higher than local market
- **Immediate payment**: No payment delays
- **Quality bonuses**: Bonus for superior quality harvests
- **Multi-year contracts**: Security and stability for families

## Training and Empowerment
